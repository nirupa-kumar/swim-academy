# Getting Started

Follow the [Installation](#installation) instructions below to create your environment for developing SWIM applications.

Refer to the [SWIM Academy Wiki](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/wiki) for an overview of SWIM concepts.

We highly recommend that you go through at LEAST the [basics](basics/services) tutorial to see how these concepts manifest themselves in a real SWIM application.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

* Install [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Ensure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointed to the Java 8 installation location. Ensure that your PATH includes $JAVA_HOME.

* Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/). Ensure that your PATH includes the Gradle `bin` directory.

## Option 1: Developing with Local .jars

1. Create a new directory and navigate inside it.

2. Add the top-level [build.gradle](build.gradle) to this directory.

3. Add the [`libs`](libs) directory and its contents.

## Option 2: Building with Artifactory TODO

Add the following dependencies in your `build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'ai.SWIM:SWIM-client:0.1.0.20180216001614'
  compile 'ai.SWIM:SWIM-server:0.1.0.20180216001614'
}
```

and the following repository

```groovy
repositories {
  maven {
    url 'https://repo.SWIM.it/SWIM-releases/'
    credentials {
      username "${artifactoryUserName}"
      password "${artifactoryUserPassword}"
    }
    authentication {
      digest(BasicAuthentication)
    }
  }
}
```
---

Once either of the above options has been exercised, you can import the `build.gradle` into your IDE of choice and start developing. Alternatively, you can create your source files manually as long as you conform to Gradle's [standard directory layout](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_project_layout).

To build the application, run `gradle build` from a shell pointed to the application's home directory. This will additionally create a `.zip` and a `.tar` in `APP_HOME/build/distributions` that, when unpackaged, contain scripts in the `bin/` directory that enable running standalone.

Alternatively, if you don't mind running through the Gradle VM, `gradle run` will both build and run the application.

# Creating Your Own SWIM Application

SWIM is an eventually consistent, real-time, distributed object system. The building blocks of a SWIM server are `Services`, `Lanes`, `Links`, and a single `Plane`, where

* `Services` are objects
* `Lanes` are the fields and methods, of `Services`
* `Links` are references to `Lanes` in `Services`
* The `Plane` is a collection of `Service` definitions.

Public `Services` and `Lanes` form a SWIM API (streaming API over web-sockets).

We again refer you to the [SWIM Academy Wiki](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/wiki) for a detailed overview of these SWIM concepts.
 
There are just three steps to build a SWIM Application.

1. Write SWIM `Services` with appropriate `Lane` declarations and configurations
2. Define a `Plane` with all `ServiceType` fields appropriately declared and all desired configurations loaded
3. Ingest data into `Lanes` using `commands` or `Downlinks`, via either a `SwimClient` instance or an external program

That's it! `Services` spawn lazily when a URI associated with a `Service` or `Lane` instance is invoked for the first time, so SWIM `Services` will process data immediately upon its availability without requiring their explicit instantiation.
