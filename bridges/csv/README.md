# Overview

This project is an [ingress bridge](https://developer.swim.ai/bridges/ingress). While most use-cases for SWIM involve streaming data sources, static data is still data, and therefore should be supported in our definition of an ingress bridge.

The steps to create this bridge have the following implementations in this project:

1. *Logic to receive source data*
  * Logic that reads CSV data line by line from a file on disk
2. *Transforming this data to SWIM API calls*
  * Constructing sets that each contain a single `nodeUri`, `laneUri`, and value (in this case, a `Recon Record`), then creating a SWIM `command` message from each set
3. *Running a SWIM Server with the Service and Lane definitions required to accept these API calls*
  * Writing appropriate `Services`, `Lanes`, and a `Plane` to ensure that the above SWIM `commands` have valid endpoints

Note that these high-level steps generalize to *any* static files; our using CSV is an *implementation*, not at all a *restriction*.

# Source Walkthrough

## package util

### [CSVUtil.java](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/blob/master/bridges/csv/src/main/java/ai/swim/util/CSVUtil.java)

We designate `CSVUtil` class responsible for Steps 1. and 2. of the aforementioned steps. Its only public method, `relayExternalData()`, has three tasks:

1. Read some `.csv` from disk one line at a time and assumes that the first line is a header
2. Construct a SWIM `command` message from the data available in both the header and the current line
3. Send the message to SWIM

The exact structure of the `command` message in tasks 2. and 3. depends on the SWIM API that is available, i.e. the `Service`, `Lane`, and `Plane` implementations in the SWIM Server that we are talking to. Thus, we blackbox these steps for now as a function, `sendReconToSwim`, that takes any and all parameters required to build the `commmand` and sends the `command` to a SWIM Server.

## package service

Each of the three implementations of `CSVUtil.sendReconToSwim()` above corresponds to **exactly one** of the three `___Service.java` files below. Running the project as is exposes every one of these, but in practice, one would probably only keep one of these files and remove the other two routes from `MyPlane.java`.

### [FileService.java](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/blob/master/bridges/csv/src/main/java/ai/swim/service/FileService.java)

The least structured implementation. All the data from one file is sent to one `FileService` instance.

### [ColumnService.java](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/blob/master/bridges/csv/src/main/java/ai/swim/service/ColumnService.java)

Preferred if computation or other processing is required within a column. All the data from one column, even across files, is sent to one `ColumnService` instance.

### [ComboService.java](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/blob/master/bridges/csv/src/main/java/ai/swim/service/ComboService.java)

Best or worth of both the above worlds, depending on your use case. The combination of filename and column name forms an identifier. All the data corresponding to one of these identifiers is sent to one `ComboService` instance.

---

For example, if we had two identically structured `.csv` files, each containing four columns, we would have one of

* Two `FileService` instances
* Four `ColumnService` instances
* Eight `ComboService` instances

The number of rows affects `Lanes` contents, not the `Service` instance counts.

### [MyPlane.java](https://github.com/swimit/swim-academy/blob/master/bridges/csv/src/main/java/ai/swim/service/MyPlane.java)

Nothing too special here other than that the `SwimRoute` corresponding to `ComboService` contains two dynamic components.
